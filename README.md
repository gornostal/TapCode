---

## Install

Install TapCode globally via npm:

### Quick Start

```bash
tapcode
```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:2025` by default.

### Configuration

Configure TapCode using environment variables:

| Variable             | Description                                          | Default     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `TAPCODE_HOST`       | Network interface the server binds to                | `127.0.0.1` |
| `TAPCODE_PORT`       | Port the server listens on                           | `2025`      |
| `TAPCODE_BASIC_AUTH` | Enable HTTP Basic Auth (format: `username:password`) | disabled    |

**Example:**

```bash
export TAPCODE_HOST=0.0.0.0
export TAPCODE_PORT=3000
export TAPCODE_BASIC_AUTH=admin:secretpassword
tapcode
```

## Workflow

1. **Add a Task** - Create coding tasks through the web interface
2. **Review Code** - Examine code generated by the AI agent
3. **Provide Feedback** - Steer the agent with additional instructions
4. **Iterate** - Refine the output until it meets your requirements
5. **Apply Changes** - Integrate the generated code into your project
