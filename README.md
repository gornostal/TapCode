## What is TapCode

‚úî A mobile-first programming interface that focuses on AI-assisted coding. <br />
‚úî A task-oriented coding workflow where developers create tasks, run them using coding agents, review code, and continue iterating until the desired result. <br />
‚úî A web-based interface that allows creating tasks for AI agents, running CLI commands, browsing code, and doing basic GIT operations. <br />
‚úî A client-server NodeJS application written with TypeScript, Express, Vite, React, and TailwindCSS. <br />

**What it is NOT:**

‚ùå A code editor or IDE replacement: TapCode doesn't provide file editing capabilities at all. <br />
‚ùå A full-featured AI coding assistant: TapCode focuses on task-based coding. It currently does not support interactive chat with AI agents (it might be added in the future). <br />
‚ùå A cloud service: TapCode runs locally on your machine, ensuring your code and data remain private. <br />

## Features

TapCode helps developers code effectively from smartphones by pairing them with coding agents.

**Mobile-First Development**: Programming workflow optimized for smartphone screens. SSH terminal might be required for more complex tasks <br />

**Project File Browsing**: Navigate and view project files in a mobile-friendly way with code syntax highlighting <br />

**Task-Oriented Approach**: Easily annotate code and create coding tasks for AI agents <br />

**Task Execution With Coding Agents**: Currently only `Claude Code` and `OpenAI Codex` agents are supported in _non-interactive_ mode. <br />

**Basic GIT Operations**: View git status, diff, stage & commit changes <br />

**Web-Based Interface**: Review generated code from your mobile web browser, execute CLI command tasks using agents <br />

**Runs Locally Or In The Cloud**: Run it on your home machine -> at night -- when you dreamed of a new feature -- pick up a phone and start TapCoding. You can also program on the go if you run TapCode on a cloud VM. <br />

## Install

Install TapCode globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g tapcode

# then run by specifying the project directory
tapcode /path/to/your/project
```

Or run directly without installation using npx:

```bash
npx tapcode .
```

**Requirements:**

- Node.js >= 18

## Workflow

| Step | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <img src="./docs/01-search-file.jpg" height="200">                 | Use the file browser or the global search to quickly locate files in your repository.                                                                                                                                                      |

| <img src="./docs/04-run-task-with-agent.jpg" height="200">         | From the task list, select a task and tap the ü§ñ icon on the toolbar to hand off your request to a coding agent.                                                                                                                           |

If you want to do a planning first, define a task to save the plan to a file and then create a new task to execute the plan. |
| <img src="./docs/06-live-stream-agent-output.jpg" height="200">    | Follow real-time terminal logs as the selected agent executes commands and edits your codebase.                                                                                                                                            |
| <img src="./docs/07-review-generated-code.jpg" height="200">       | Inspect the resulting diffs and code previews to confirm the agent's changes are correct. <br /> Create new annotations from here if you want to make changes.                                                                             |
| <img src="./docs/08-run-any-additional-commands.jpg" height="200"> | Run any follow-up shell commands directly from the app to continue iterating on the task.                                                                                                                                                  |

## Configure

By default the server will starts on `http://127.0.0.1:2025`.

Configure TapCode using environment variables:

| Variable             | Description                                          | Default     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `TAPCODE_HOST`       | Network interface the server binds to                | `127.0.0.1` |
| `TAPCODE_PORT`       | Port the server listens on                           | `2025`      |
| `TAPCODE_BASIC_AUTH` | Enable HTTP Basic Auth (format: `username:password`) | disabled    |

> **Security Note**: Basic auth does not encrypt traffic. Use it only over secure networks or keep the default host name and forward via SSH tunnel.

**Example:**

```bash
export TAPCODE_HOST=0.0.0.0  # will listen on all interfaces
export TAPCODE_PORT=3000
export TAPCODE_BASIC_AUTH=username:secretpassword
tapcode .
```
