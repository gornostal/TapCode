# Instructions

Implement the first task, run tests, remove the item from this file and then stop.

Note: This file may change while work is being done - new items may be added.

# Tasks

- I need this project to be run via `npm run dev .` and via `npm build && npm start -- .`
  Currently `npm run dev` works, but the built code doesn't.
  Fix the issue and verify the fix by running both and making sure there are no errors.
  Avoid adding .js extensions across server side codebase imports.
