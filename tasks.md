# Instructions

Implement the first task, run tests, remove the item from this file.

Note: This file may change while work is being done - new items may be added.

# Tasks

- move title (h1) from the page section to a static header bar that shows just the project name in the middle

- instead of having "back to files" button and current di/file name in the body, create a fixed bar above the toolbar that will display current path, and the "back" button on the far right

- create a unit test for file utils that has "\*.log" line in gitignore and "test.log" file in the temp test dir. Run the tests (it will fail). Fix the implementation until tests pass

- file view should show line numbers
