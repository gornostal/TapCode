# Instructions

Implement the first todo item, run tests, remove the item from this file.

Note: This file may change while work is being done - new items may be added.

# TODO

- create a new category of git-related APIs. The first api will be to get git status

- Add some sort of visual aid to each todo item that will suggest the user that they can be dragged to reorder

- create a unit test for file utils that has "\*.log" line in gitignore and "test.log" file in the temp test dir. Run the tests (it will fail). Fix the implementation until tests pass

- instead of having "back to files" button and current di/file name in the body, create a fixed bar above the toolbar that will display current path, and the "back" button on the far right

- move title (h1) from the page section to a static header bar that shows just the project name in the middle

- Implement API for reordering todo items. It should accept current index and new index in the list

- Implement reordering feature on the UI (API exists): I should be able to drag individual todo items around and when I drop them the new order is saved

- The Add Item function in todos should support multiline input. Do this by keeping the one-line input, but adding a button to open a multiline text area on a new page or modal.

- file view should show line numbers
